# Explanation:
This problem is very straight forward, you will get a string that will represent a sentence in binary code, and you need to translate that into words. There is not direct way to do this so you will have to translate twice.

## Hint: 1
You should first convert from **binary** to **decimal** before translating those values into characters

## Hint: 2
Things are easier when focusing on smaller parts, divide the input to focus on one letter at the time.

## Hint: 3
Make sure that each time you transcode a character from binary to decimal, you reset whatever variable you used to keep track of the ones. Also do not forget to turn everything back into one string.

## Spoiler Alert!

**Solution ahead!**

## Code Solution 1:

```js
function binaryAgent(str) {
  biString = str.split(' ');
  uniString = [];
  
/*using the radix (or base) parameter in parseInt, we can convert the binary 
  number to a decimal number while simultaneously converting to a char*/

   for(i=0;i < biString.length;i++){
   uniString.push(String.fromCharCode(parseInt(biString[i], 2))); 
  }
//we then simply join the string
  return uniString.join('');
}
```
# Code Explanation:
- Separate the string into an array of strings separated by whitespace.
- Create some variables that will be needed along the way, the names are self explanatory for the most part.
- Iterate through each binary string in the new array.
- Convert to decimal by using parseInt(*binary*, 2) (with the second parameter we tell in which base our numbers currently are) 
- At the end, we return out converted message.

## Code Solution 2:

```js
function binaryAgent(str) {
  // Separate the binary code by space.
  str = str.split(' ');
  var power;
  var decValue = 0;
  var sentence = '';

  // Check each binary number from the array.
  for (var s = 0; s < str.length; s++) {
    // Check each bit from binary number
    for (var t = 0; t < str[s].length; t++) {
      // This only takes into consideration the active ones.
      if (str[s][t] == 1) {
        // This is quivalent to 2 ** position
        power = Math.pow(2, +str[s].length - t - 1);
        decValue += power;

        // Record the decimal value by adding the number to the previous one.
      }
    }

    // After the binary number is converted to decimal, convert it to string and store
    sentence += (String.fromCharCode(decValue));

    // Reset decimal value for next binary number.
    decValue = 0;
  }

  return sentence;
}
```
# Code Explanation
- For each of these binary strings, check for the ones and ignore the zeroes.
- For those that are one or active then convert them to decimal, this takes into account the position and the right power it needs to be raised to.
- Store the power into the **power** variable by adding it to any previous ones on the variable **decValue**. This variable will add and add the powers of the active ones until the end of the loop and then return the decimal number.
- Convert the final decimal outside of the inner loop and then convert it to ASCII and saving it to **sentence** along with any other text string already converted and stored.
- Reset the variable **decValue** to avoid getting wrong decimals before continuing to the outer loop.

## Code Solution 3:

```js
function binaryAgent(str) {
  return String.fromCharCode(...str.split(" ").map(function(char){ return parseInt(char, 2); }));
}
```

# Code Explanation
- First we use `split()` to be able to work on each character as an Array element
- Then use `map()` to process each element  from binary to decimal using `pareseInt()`
- Last we can use `String.fromCharCode()` to convert each ASCII number into the corresponding character
- However `fromCharCode()` expects a series of numbers rather than an Array! We can use ES6 Spread Operator to pass in an Array of numbers as individual numbers. See here for more info; https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator

## Code Solution 4:

```js
function binaryAgent(str) {
  var re = /(\d+)(\s?)/g;
  function convertToChar(match,p1,p2){
    return String.fromCharCode(parseInt(p1, 2));
  }
  return str.replace(re, convertToChar);
}
```

# Code Explanation
- In this solution we use `String.replace()` to find all the binary numbers and convert them to characters
- First we use a regular expression to find all the binary numbers and optional trailing spaces
- Then we define a function that converts the first parenthesized submatch into a number `parseInt()` and then into a character`String.fromCharCode()`. By not using the second parenthisized submatch we leave out all the spaces that where in between the binary numbers.
- Lastly we use our defined regex and function in the `String.replace()` function.

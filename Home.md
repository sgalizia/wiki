# Welcome to the Free Code Camp Wiki!
Our open source community's Wiki focuses on answering your questions about learning to code and getting a coding job. We also cover in detail our:
- Curriculum
- Local Campsite Communities
- Nonprofit Projects

The best way to access this wiki is via [CamperBot](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/camperbot), located in our Gitter channels. CamperBot is a community designed tool useful for accessing our wiki content without ever leaving Gitter.

## Contributing to the Wiki
To contribute a wiki article for any of the Algorithms, please use this [template](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/Algorithm-Wiki-Template). This is essential for [@CamperBot](https://github.com/camperbot) to retrieve the article. Algorithm articles that do not use this template will be removed. Please note that while we will publish solutions that can help others, we don't need many of them and a maximum of three solutions will be accepted in the following categories:
- Basic
- Intermediate
- Advance

One code solution per category. If we already have enough solutions and yours is similar to one we already have but you strongly feel like yours will bring something important then we encourage you to merge your solution with the similar one we already have and expand or write a detailed explanation of the code.

If you want to contribute but have no idea what you would like to contribute then feel free to check the open issues we have with request for articles or fixes to them [here.](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/issues)

We welcome **any technology relate articles**, not just JavaScript related or Curriculum specific. However, we do ask that you write them in third person instead of first person perspective. We also welcome articles in **other languages**, and welcome **translations** of current articles.

If we merge your pull request, your name will be automatically added to the document history on GitHub, and the repo's contributors. Please don't add additional bylines when creating or editing an article.

### Guides on how to Contribute
- [How To Contribute From Your Browser](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/Guide-Online-Contribution) This is currently the easiest way we have to contribute. A simplified version can be found on [here](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-to-land-your-first-open-source-contribution-from-your-browser-in-15-minutes-756d9bbf81ad) also.
- [How To Contribute To The Wiki:](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/How-To-Contribute-To-The-Wiki) This is a guide that will show you how to have a local copy so you can make changes from your computer, it also works for contributing to the main repository.
- [How to Squash Commits:](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/git-rebase#squashing-multiple-commits-into-one) We required only one commit per Pull Request unless otherwise specified by a moderator.

If you have questions about contributing to the Free Code Camp Wiki message [@Rafase282 in Gitter](https://gitter.im/Rafase282) or come the [Gitter Wiki Room.](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/Wiki)

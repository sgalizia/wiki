Translation is an all-or-nothing proposal.

We won't be able to add new languages to Free Code Camp until all of our 
challenges are translated into that language.

In addition to translating these initially, we'll also need to maintain 
the translation as the challenges are gradually updated.

If you're able to help us, please join the gitter channel 
https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/Translators 
And also join the channel for translators of your specific language 
(if it exists):

* Brazilian Portuguese: https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/BrazilianPortuguese
* Korean: https://gitter.im/StephenMayeux/koreantranslations
* Spanish: https://gitter.im/AlexTrapp/FreeCodeCampEspa%C3%B1ol

If it doesn't exist we invite you to create one and share it on
  https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/Translators

We invite you to read some recommendations based on the spanish team
experience:
  https://github.com/vtamara/fcc_trad/blob/master/Recomendaciones.EN.md

Please adapt them to your team (we encourage you to translate them to make 
it easier for people that speaks your language).

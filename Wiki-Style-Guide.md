###"Wiki" is a Hawaiian word meaning "quick". Keep this in mind when creating wiki articles.

We are always happy to help new contributors write, edit, and localize our wiki articles. Help us make Free Code Camp the best it can be.

You can create a new wiki page by clicking the "New Page" button at top right.

Keep your wiki articles short and focused.

You can include images if they help you better communicate your subject.

#### Use descriptive, punctuation-free titles that follow a name convention as `Name of Page`.
Our wiki articles are [written in GitHub-flavor Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

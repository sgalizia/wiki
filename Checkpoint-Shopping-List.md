# Instructions
Create a shopping list in the variable `myList`. The list should be a multi-dimensional array containing several sub-arrays.

The first element in each sub-array should contain a string with the name of the item. The second element should be a number representing the quantity.

`["Chocolate Bar", 15]`

There should be at least 5 sub-arrays in the list.

Remember to use [ Read-Search-Ask](http://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/freecodecamp/wiki/How-to-get-help-when-you-get-stuck) if you get stuck. Try to pair program. Write your own code.

## Problem Explanation:
- `myList` should be an array.
- The first elements in each of your sub-arrays must all be strings.
- The second elements in each of your sub-arrays must all be numbers.
- You must have at least 5 items in your list.

## Hint: 1
- A multi-dimensional array would have the following outline `[[]]`

## Hint: 2
- Each sub-array should be separated by `,` as would any item in an array.

## Hint: 3
- Don't forget the `;` at the end of your declaration.

# Overview
This guide will help you log in to your local FCC site using your GitHub account. This process should be similar for logging in with other social media accounts. This guide assumes you already have a local copy of FCC up and running.

### TL;DR

2. Homepage field: `http://localhost:3000/`
3. Callback field: `http://localhost:3000/auth/github/callback`
4. Copy/paste the Client ID and Client Secret into your `.env` file
5. Use port 3000 when viewing your local FCC site

## Disclaimer
The output from running `$ gulp` mentions the **Access Port** is 3001. I have only successfully logged in with GitHub at port 3000 - the **Proxy Port**. If you understand how to log in using other ports, please consider submitting a pull request on this wiki.

## Log In Using Your GitHub Account
1. Register a new OAuth application at https://github.com/settings/developers and click **Register new application**
<br><br>
*Alternatively*, click your **Profile Picture** => **Settings** => **Applications** => **Developer applications** => **Register new application**
<br><br>

  * **Homepage URL** - set to `http://localhost:3000/`

## Tips
1. Remove / unset with comment block the unwanted provider in [passport-provider](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/blob/staging/server/passport-providers.js).

2. Add SESSION_SECRET and COOKIE_SECRET in `.env` if you get error on express-session and cookieParser.
```
COOKIE_SECRET='secret'
SESSION_SECRET='secret'
```
3. Run command `node seed` before run `gulp` if you dont get the challenges.

## Finished
Congratulations! You can now successfully log into your local FCC site using your GitHub account.

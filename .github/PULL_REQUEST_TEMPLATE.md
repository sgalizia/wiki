## FreeCodeCamp - Wiki Pull Request Template

Make sure your contribution addresses the points mentioned below:

**Filenames:**

- Your filename should NOT contain any special characters or spaces.

- Use only "-" to separate words in the filename.

- Filenames should have the ".md" extension.

**Formatting:**

- Ensure that you use markdown syntax for articles.

- Checkout the guides for reference:

1. [Master Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
2. [Working with Advanced Formatting](https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-advanced-formatting/)

**Commits and Squashing:**

- Your Pull Request/Submission should have only one commit.

- For multiple commits follow the [guide to squash them](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/git-rebase#squashing-multiple-commits-into-one)

- If you are new to contributing then you can [use the browser](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/Guide-Online-Contribution),
  and we will squash multiple commits for you if requested. 

- However, for more control over the pull request we recommend that you [use the local method](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/How-To-Contribute-To-The-Wiki) 
  and request you to squash the commits yourself.

**Signing off:**

- If we merge your pull request, your name will be automatically added to the 
  document history on GitHub, and the repo's contributors. 
  Please don't add additional bylines when creating or editing an article.

Put `closes #XXXX` in your comment to auto-close the issue (if applicable), 
only if your Pull Request is addressing the issue COMPLETELY, else just leave 
a comment on the original issue with the Pull Request number.

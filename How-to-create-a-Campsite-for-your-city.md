If you didn't see your city on [our list of Campsites](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/freecodecamp/wiki/List-of-Free-Code-Camp-city-based-Campsites), you should create your own Facebook group for your city.<br>
We like keeping things as local as possible, so please create groups only for cities, or even smaller areas. 

Please, do not create campsites for a whole State/province/department/county/etc. as they will not be added to the list.

<br> 
Now, to the fun part!
It's easy, just follow these steps: 
- Sign in to Facebook. 
- Click the down arrow in the upper right corner of the screen, then choose "Create Group" from the options.

![A screenshot of Facebook showing the drop down menu that appears when you click the down arrow, with an arrow pointing to the "Create Group" option](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s116/sh/d01bb2bc-6260-4987-bedf-b2ce4c31972f/3eecbcff3109036cf90b69589360f407/deep/0/Facebook.png)

<br>
- Set the group name as "Free Code Camp" plus the proper name of your city.<br>Avoid using slang terms such as "Philly" for "Philadelphia". If your city is not the biggest city that uses its name, also include the state or province. For example, the Free Code Camp group in Paris, France should be called "Free Code Camp Paris". The Free Code Camp group in Paris, Texas should be called "Free Code Camp Paris, Texas".<br>If you are in North America, we suggest you add the initials of your state/province here.
- Set your group to public. 
- You'll need to add at least one friend from your city to this group in order to create the group.

<br>
- Choose the graduation cap icon to indicate that this group is related to a school.

<br>

<br>
- Set the group's privacy setting to public. 
- Set your group's membership approval to where any member can add or approve members ![a screenshot showing the Facebook settings panel and where you can click to set the group to public and allow all members to be able to add or approve members

<br>
- Click the "Customize Address" button.
- Enter "free.code.camp.your.city" with each word separated by periods. 
<br><br>**(Not "your.city"! this is just an example)**

![a screenshot telling you to enter free.code.camp.your.city.name with each word seperated by periods.](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s116/sh/357b1bd9-7c40-4f72-8a9a-d918e632a5e8/c4714ca59360b2517dfffe90c60b1556/deep/0/Free-Code-Camp-Testland.png)

<br>
- Please feel free to personalize your city's group description, but be sure to include a link to Free Code Camp: "http://www.freecodecamp.com".  It makes it much easier for possible new members to find you if you mention the country your city is in (or its state/province if in North America).<br><br>**Note: in this image, we also use "Testland" as an example, but you should use the name of your city instead.**

<br>
- Click the "Upload a photo button. To start out, you'll probably just want to use Free Code Camp's banner (download it [here](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/blob/master/images/FCC-FBbanner.png)), or a scenic shot of your city. Later you can update this with a picture from one of your city's Free Code Camp events.

<br>
- And finally, [message Justin (@hallaathrad on Gitter)](https://gitter.im/hallaathrad) with a link to your city's group page. He'll include it in the list.
- Join our [Local Leaders Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/freecodecampers/), where we share ideas about involving campers in your city. 

If you don't have a Facebook account, we strongly recommend you create one, even if it's just for the purpose of coordinating with campers in your city through this group.
